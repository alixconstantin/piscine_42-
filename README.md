# 42 Piscine - 42 Paris (September 2023)

## Overview
In September 2023, I embarked on the challenging yet enriching journey of the 42 Piscine at 42 Paris. This intensive program spans over a month, operating 7 days a week, and is designed to immerse participants in the fundamentals of Shell scripting and the C programming language.

## Key Highlights

- **Introduction to Shell and C:** The program offers a comprehensive introduction to Shell and C programming, laying a solid foundation for future learning and development.
- **Preparation for Examinations:** Various modules were completed to prepare for examinations. Please note, the exam content is not available here.
- **Recreating Native C Functions:** A core objective of the program was to recreate native C functions without using existing library functions (except `write`, `malloc`, and `free`). This exercise was crucial in understanding the intricacies of these functions and served as an introduction to algorithmic thinking.
- **Coding Standards:** The modules adhered to specific coding standards to promote cohesion in peer-learning environments.
- **Moulinette Testing:** All functions were rigorously tested using a program called "Moulinette." This process was crucial in identifying potential security vulnerabilities and encouraged the practice of writing robust, secure code.
- **Function Variations:** Some functions in the modules may exhibit slight variations from their official prototypes, though these do not impact overall functionality.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** It's possible that some functions have additional (or fewer) vulnerabilities compared to their official counterparts.
- **Personal Testing Recommended:** Despite the availability of official tests, it is highly recommended to conduct personal testing to ensure maximum security and reliability.
